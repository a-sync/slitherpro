### WARNING! ###
Don't install any of those shady extensions / mods / hacks! All they do, is load various obfuscated scripts from third party websites.
Yes, they include some mods, but they are not included directly in the downloaded files, and they also include some other things, like some google analytics tracking code, scripts loaded from shady domains, and websocket connections to third party URL's.
Remember: whoever controls these domains, can control the script files that are loaded in your browser every time you open the website and use the mod.
They can include any type of code, and they can change it and serve up a different content every time or any time.
